### Session 1: Machine Learning 1

#### In-Datacenter Performance Analysis of a Tensor Processing Unit :star:
Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC—called a ​Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) — deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU’s deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs (caches, out-of-order execution, multithreading, multiprocessing, prefetching, …) that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters’ NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X - 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X - 80X higher. Moreover, using the GPU’s GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.

#### SCALEDEEP: A Scalable Compute Architecture for Learning and Evaluating Deep Networks :star:
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of tasks involving natural language, speech, image, and video processing, and are deployed in many real world applications. However, DNNs impose significant computational challenges owing to the complexity of the networks and the amount of data they process, both of which are projected to grow in the future. To improve the efficiency of DNNs, we propose ScaleDeep, a dense, scalable server architecture, whose processing, memory and interconnect subsystems are specialized to leverage the compute and communication characteristics of DNNs. While several DNN accelerator designs have been proposed in recent years, the key difference is that ScaleDeep primarily targets DNN training, as opposed to only inference or evaluation. The key architectural features from which ScaleDeep derives its efficiency are: (i) heterogeneous processing tiles and chips to match the wide diversity in computational characteristics (FLOPs and Bytes/FLOP ratio) that manifest at different levels of granularity in DNNs, (ii) a memory hierarchy and 3-tiered interconnect topology that is suited to the memory access and communication patterns in DNNs, (iii) a low-overhead synchronization mechanism based on hardware data-flow trackers, and (iv) methods to map DNNs to the proposed architecture that minimize data movement and improve core utilization through nested pipelining. We have developed a compiler to allow any DNN topology to be programmed onto ScaleDeep, and a detailed architectural simulator to estimate performance and energy. The simulator incorporates timing and power models of ScaleDeep's components based on synthesis to Intel's 14nm technology. We evaluate an embodiment of ScaleDeep with 7032 processing tiles that operates at 600 MHz and has a peak performance of 680 TFLOPs (single precision) and 1.35 PFLOPs (half-precision) at 1.4KW. Across 11 state-of-the-art DNNs containing 0.65M-14.9M neurons and 6.8M-145.9M weights, including winners from 5 years of the ImageNet competition, ScaleDeep demonstrates 6x-28x speedup at iso-power over the state-of-the-art performance on GPUs.

#### SCNN: An Accelerator for Compressed-sparse Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a fundamental technology for machine learning. High performance and extreme energy efficiency are critical for deployments of CNNs in a wide range of situations, especially mobile platforms such as autonomous vehicles, cameras, and electronic personal assistants. This paper introduces the Sparse CNN (SCNN) accelerator architecture, which improves performance and energy efficiency by exploiting the zero-valued weights that stem from network pruning during training and zero-valued activations that arise from the common ReLU operator applied during inference. Specifically, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining the sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates unnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the SCNN dataflow facilitates efficient delivery of those weights and activations to the multiplier array, where they are extensively reused. In addition, the accumulation of multiplication products are performed in a novel accumulator array. Our results show that on contemporary neural networks, SCNN can improve both performance and energy by a factor of 2.7x and 2.3x, respectively, over a comparably provisioned dense CNN accelerator.

### Session 2A: IoT
#### Bespoke Processors for Applications with Ultra-low Area and Power Constraints
A large number of emerging applications such as implantables, wearables, printed electronics, and IoT have ultra-low area and power constraints. These applications rely on ultra-low-power general purpose microcontrollers and microprocessors, making them the most abundant type of processor produced and used today. While general purpose processors have several advantages, such as amortized development cost across many applications, they are significantly over-provisioned for many area- and power-constrained systems, which tend to run only one or a small number of applications over their lifetime. In this paper, we make a case for bespoke processor design, an automated approach that tailors a general purpose processor IP to a target application by removing all gates from the design that can never be used by the application. Since removed gates are never used by an application, bespoke processors can achieve significantly lower area and power than their general purpose counterparts without any performance degradation. Also, gate removal can expose additional timing slack that can be exploited to increase area and power savings or performance of a bespoke design. Bespoke processor design reduces area and power by 62% and 50%, on average, while exploiting exposed timing slack improves average power savings to 65%.

#### A Programmable Galois Field Processor for the Internet of Things
This paper investigates the feasibility of a unified processor architecture to enable error coding flexibility and secure communication in low power Internet of Things (IoT) wireless networks. Error coding flexibility for wireless communication allows IoT applications to exploit the large tradeoff space in data rate, link distance and energy-efficiency. As a solution, we present a light-weight Galois Field (GF) processor to enable energy-efficient block coding and symmetric/asymmetric cryptography kernel processing for a wide range of GF sizes (2m, m = 2, 3, ..., 233) and arbitrary irreducible polynomials. Program directed connections among primitive GF arithmetic units enable dynamically configured parallelism to efficiently perform either four-way SIMD 5- to 8-bit GF operations, including multiplicative inverse, or a wide bit-width (e.g., 32-bit) GF product in a single cycle. To illustrate our ideas, we synthesized our GF processor in a 28nm technology. Compared to a baseline software implementation optimized for a general purpose ARM M0+ processor, our processor exhibits a 5-20 x speedup for a range of error correction codes and symmetric/asymmetric cryptography applications. Additionally, our proposed GF processor consumes 431μW at 0.9V and 100MHz, and achieves 35.5pJ/b energy efficiency while executing AES operations at 12.2Mbps. We achieve this within an area of 0.01mm2.

#### XPro: A Cross-End Processing Architecture for Data Analytics in Wearables :star:
Wearable computing systems have spurred many opportunities to continuously monitor human bodies with sensors worn on or implanted in the body. These emerging platforms have started to revolutionize many fields, including healthcare and wellness applications, particularly when integrated with intelligent analytic capabilities. However, a significant challenge that computer architects are facing is how to embed sophisticated analytic capabilities in wearable computers in an energy-efficient way while not compromising system performance. In this paper, we present XPro, a novel cross-end analytic engine architecture for wearable computing systems. The proposed cross-end architecture is able to realize a generic classification design across wearable sensors and a data aggregator with high energy-efficiency. To facilitate the practical use of XPro, we also develop an Automatic XPro Generator that formally generates XPro instances according to specific design constraints. As a proof of concept, we study the design and implementation of XPro with six different health applications. Evaluation results show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, XPro can increase the battery life of the sensor node by 1.6-2.4X while at the same time reducing system delay by 15.6-60.8% for wearable computing systems.

### Session 2B: Security 1

#### Regaining Lost Cycles with HotCalls: A Fast Interface for SGX Secure Enclaves :star:
Intel’s SGX secure execution technology allows running computations on secret data using untrusted servers. While recent work showed how to port applications and large-scale computations to run under SGX, the performance implications of using the technology remains an open question. We present the first comprehensive quantitative study to evaluate the performance of SGX. We show that straightforward use of SGX library primitives for calling functions add between 8,200 - 17,000 cycles overhead, compared to 150 cycles of a typical system call. We quantify the performance impact of these library calls and show that in applications with high system calls frequency, such as memcached, openVPN, and lighttpd, which all have high bandwidth network requirements, the performance degradation may be as high as 79%. We investigate the sources of this performance degradation by leveraging a new set of microbenchmarks for SGX-specific operations such as enclave entry-calls and out-calls, and encrypted memory I/O accesses. We leverage the insights we gain from these analyses to design a new SGX interface framework HotCalls. HotCalls are based on a synchronization spin-lock mechanism and provide a 13-27x speedup over the default interface. It can easily be integrated into existing code, making it a practical solution. Compared to a baseline SGX implementation of memcached, openVPN, and lighttpd - we show that using the new interface boosts the throughput by 2.6-3.7x, and reduces application latency by 62-74%.

#### InvisiMem: Smart Memory Defenses for Memory Bus Side Channel :star:
A practically feasible low-overhead hardware design that provides strong defenses against memory bus side channel remains elusive. This paper observes that smart memory, memory with compute capability and a packetized interface, can dramatically simplify this problem. InvisiMem expands the trust base to include the logic layer in the smart memory to implement cryptographic primitives, which aid in addressing several memory bus side channel vulnerabilities efficiently. This allows the secure host processor to send encrypted addresses over the untrusted memory bus, and thereby eliminates the need for expensive address obfuscation techniques based on Oblivious RAM (ORAM). In addition, smart memory enables efficient solutions for ensuring freshness without using expensive Merkle trees, and mitigates memory bus timing channel using constant heart-beat packets. We demonstrate that InvisiMem designs have one to two orders of magnitude of lower overheads for performance, space, energy, and memory bandwidth, compared to prior solutions.

#### ObfusMem: A low-overhead access obfuscation for trusted memories
Trustworthy software requires strong privacy and security guarantees from a secure trust base in hardware. While chipmakers provide hardware support for basic security and privacy primitives such as enclaves and memory encryption. these primitives do not address hiding of the memory access pattern, information about which may enable attacks on the system or reveal characteristics of sensitive user data. State-of-the-art approaches to protecting the access pattern are largely based on Oblivious RAM (ORAM). Unfortunately, current ORAM implementations suffer from very significant practicality and overhead concerns, including roughly an order of magnitude slowdown, more than 100% memory capacity overheads, and the potential for system deadlock. Memory technology trends are moving towards 3D and 2.5D integration, enabling significant logic capabilities and sophisticated memory interfaces. Leveraging the trends, we propose a new approach to access pattern obfuscation, called ObfusMem. ObfusMem adds the memory to the trusted computing base and incorporates cryptographic engines within the memory. ObfusMem encrypts commands and addresses on the memory bus, hence the access pattern is cryptographically obfuscated from external observers. Our evaluation shows that ObfusMem incurs an overhead of 10.9% on average, which is about an order of magnitude faster than ORAM implementations. Furthermore, ObfusMem does not incur capacity overheads and does not amplify writes. We analyze and compare the security protections provided by ObfusMem and ORAM, and highlight their differences.

#### Chasing Away RAts: Semantics and Evaluation for Relaxed Atomics on Heterogeneous Systems
An unambiguous and easy-to-understand memory consistency model is crucial for ensuring correct synchronization and guiding future design of heterogeneous systems. In a widely adopted approach, the memory model guarantees sequential consistency (SC) as long as programmers obey certain rules. The popular data-race-free-0 (DRF0) model exemplifies this SC-centric approach by requiring programmers to avoid data races. Recent industry models, however, have extended such SC-centric models to incorporate relaxed atomics. These extensions can improve performance, but are difficult to specify formally and use correctly. This work addresses the impact of relaxed atomics on consistency models for heterogeneous systems in two ways. First, we introduce a new model, Data-Race-Free-Relaxed (DRFrlx), that extends DRF0 to provide SC-centric semantics for the common use cases of relaxed atomics. Second, we evaluate the performance of relaxed atomics in CPU-GPU systems for these use cases. We find mixed results – for most cases, relaxed atomics provide only a small benefit in execution time, but for some cases, they help significantly (e.g., up to 51% for DRFrlx over DRF0).


#### Hiding the Long Latency of Persist Barriers Using Speculative Execution
Byte-addressable non-volatile memory technology is emerging as an alternative for DRAM for main memory. This new Non-Volatile Main Memory (NVMM) allows programmers to store important data in data structures in memory instead of serializing it to the file system, thereby providing a substantial performance boost. However, modern systems reorder memory operations and utilize volatile caches for better performance, making it difficult to ensure a consistent state in NVMM. Intel recently announced a new set of persistence instructions, clflushopt, clwb, and pcommit. These new instructions make it possible to implement fail-safe code on NVMM, but few workloads have been written or characterized using these new instructions.

In this work, we describe how these instructions work and how they can be used to implement write-ahead logging based transactions. We implement several common data structures and kernels and evaluate the performance overhead incurred over traditional non-persistent implementations. In particular, we find that persistence instructions occur in clusters along with expensive fence operations, they have long latency, and they add a significant execution time overhead, on average by 20.3% over code with logging but without fence instructions to order persists.

To deal with this overhead and alleviate the performance bottleneck, we propose to speculate past long latency persistency operations using checkpoint-based processing. Our speculative persistence architecture reduces the execution time overheads to only 3.6%.

#### Non-Speculative Load-Load Reordering in TSO :star:
In Total Store Order memory consistency (TSO), loads can be speculatively reordered to improve performance. If a load-load reordering is seen by other cores, speculative loads must be squashed and re-executed. In architectures with an unordered interconnection network and directory coherence, this has been the established view for decades. We show, for the first time, that it is not necessary to squash and re-execute speculatively reordered loads in TSO when their reordering is seen. Instead, the reordering can be hidden form other cores by the coherence protocol. The implication is that we can irrevocably bind speculative loads. This allows us to commit reordered loads out-of-order without having to wait (for the loads to become non-speculative) or without having to checkpoint committed state (and rollback if needed), just to ensure correctness in the rare case of some core seeing the reordering. We show that by exposing a reordering to the coherence layer and by appropriately modifying a typical directory protocol we can successfully hide load-load reordering without perceptible performance cost and without deadlock. Our solution is cost-effective and increases the performance of out-of-order commit by a sizable margin, compared to the base case where memory operations are not allowed to commit if the consistency model could be violated.

### Session 4A: Reliability

#### MTraceCheck: Validating Non-Deterministic Behavior of Memory Consistency Models in Post-Silicon Validation
This work presents a minimally-intrusive, high-performance, post-silicon validation framework for validating memory consistency in multi-core systems. Our framework generates constrained-random tests that are instrumented with observability-enhancing code for memory consistency verification. For each test, we generate a set of compact signatures reflecting the memory-ordering patterns observed over many executions of the test, with each of the signatures corresponding to a unique memory-ordering pattern. We then leverage an efficient and novel analysis to quickly determine if the observed execution patterns represented by each unique signature abide by the memory consistency model. Our analysis derives its efficiency by exploiting the structural similarities among the patterns observed. We evaluated our framework, MTraceCheck, on two platforms: an x86-based desktop and an ARM-based SoC platform, both running multi-threaded test programs in a bare-metal environment. We show that MTraceCheck reduces the perturbation introduced by the memory-ordering monitoring activity by 93% on average, compared to a baseline register flushing approach that saves the register's state after each load operation. We also reduce the computation requirements of our consistency checking analysis by 81% on average, compared to a conventional topological sorting solution. We finally demonstrate the effectiveness of MTraceCheck on buggy designs, by evaluating multiple case studies where it successfully exposes subtle bugs in a full-system simulation environment.

#### Redundant Memory Array Architecture for Efficient Selective Protection
Memory hardware errors may result from transient particle-induced faults as well as device defects due to aging. These errors are an important threat to computer system reliability as VLSI technologies continue to scale. Managing memory hardware errors is a critical component in developing an overall system dependability strategy. Memory error detection and correction are supported in a range of available hardware mechanisms. However, memory protections (particularly the more advanced ones) come at substantial costs in performance and energy usage. Moreover, the protection mechanisms are often a fixed, system-wide choice and can not easily adapt to different protection demand of different applications or memory regions.

In this paper, we present a new RAIM (redundant array of independent memory) design that compared to the state-of-the-art implementation can easily provide high protection capability and the ability to selectively protect a subset of the memory. A straightforward implementation of the design can incur a substantial memory traffic overhead. We propose a few practical optimizations to mitigate this overhead. With these optimizations the proposed RAIM design offers significant advantages over existing RAIM design at lower or comparable costs.

#### Clank: Architectural Support for Intermittent Computation
The processors that drive embedded systems are getting smaller; meanwhile, the batteries used to provide power to those systems have stagnated. If we are to realize the dream of ubiquitous computing promised by the Internet of Things, processors must shed large, heavy, expensive, and high maintenance batteries and, instead, harvest energy from their environment. One challenge with this transition is that harvested energy is insufficient for continuous operation. Unfortunately, existing programs fail miserably when executed intermittently.

This paper presents Clank: lightweight architectural support for correct and efficient execution of long-running applications on harvested energy---without programmer intervention or extreme hardware modifications. Clank is a set of hardware buffers and memory-access monitors that dynamically maintain idempotency. Essentially, Clank dynamically decomposes program execution into a stream of restartable sub-executions connected via lightweight checkpoints.

To validate Clank's ability to correctly stretch program execution across frequent, random power cycles, and to explore the associated hardware and software overheads, we implement Clank in Verilog, formally verify it, and then add it to an ARM Cortex M0+ processor which we use to run a set of 23 embedded systems benchmarks. Experiments show run-time overheads as low as 2.5%, with run-time overheads of 6% for a version of Clank that adds 1.7% hardware. Clank minimizes checkpoints so much that re-execution time becomes the dominate contributor to run-time overhead.

### Session 4B: GPUs
#### Quality of service support for fine-grained sharing on GPUs :star:
GPUs have been widely adopted in data centers to provide acceleration services to many applications. Sharing a GPU is increasingly important for better processing throughput and energy efficiency. However, quality of service (QoS) among concurrent applications is minimally supported. Previous efforts are too coarse-grained and not scalable with increasing QoS requirements. We propose QoS mechanisms for a fine-grained form of GPU sharing. Our QoS support can provide control over the progress of kernels on a per cycle basis and the amount of thread-level parallelism of each kernel. Due to accurate resource management, our QoS support has significantly better scalability compared with previous best efforts. Evaluations show that, when the GPU is shared by three kernels, two of which have QoS goals, the proposed techniques achieve QoS goals 43.8% more often than previous techniques and have 20.5% higher throughput.

#### Accelerating GPU Hardware Transactional Memory with Snapshot Isolation :star:
Snapshot Isolation (SI) is an established model in the database community, which permits write-read conflicts to pass and aborts transactions only on write-write conflicts. With the Write Skew anomaly correctly eliminated, SI can reduce the occurrence of aborts, save the work done by transactions, and greatly benefit long transactions involving complex data structures. GPUs are evolving towards a general-purpose computing device with growing support for irregular workloads, including transactional memory. The usage of snapshot isolation on transactional memory has proven to be greatly beneficial for performance. In this paper, we propose a multi-versioned memory subsystem for hardware-based transactional memory on the GPU, with a method for eliminating the Write Skew anomaly on the fly, and finally incorporate Snapshot Isolation with this system. The results show that snapshot isolation can effectively boost the performance of dynamically sized data structures such as linked lists, binary trees and red-black trees, sometimes by as much as 4.5x, which results in improved overall performance of benchmarks utilizing these data structures.

#### Decoupled Affine Computation for SIMT GPUs :star:
An unambiguous and easy-to-understand memory consistency model is crucial for ensuring correct synchronization and guiding future design of heterogeneous systems. In a widely adopted approach, the memory model guarantees sequential consistency (SC) as long as programmers obey certain rules. The popular data-race-free-0 (DRF0) model exemplifies this SC-centric approach by requiring programmers to avoid data races. Recent industry models, however, have extended such SC-centric models to incorporate relaxed atomics. These extensions can improve performance, but are difficult to specify formally and use correctly. This work addresses the impact of relaxed atomics on consistency models for heterogeneous systems in two ways. First, we introduce a new model, Data-Race-Free-Relaxed (DRFrlx), that extends DRF0 to provide SC-centric semantics for the common use cases of relaxed atomics. Second, we evaluate the performance of relaxed atomics in CPU-GPU systems for these use cases. We find mixed results – for most cases, relaxed atomics provide only a small benefit in execution time, but for some cases, they help significantly (e.g., up to 51% for DRFrlx over DRF0).

#### Access pattern-aware cache management for improving data utilization in GPU
 Long latency of memory operation is a prominent performance bottleneck in graphics processing units (GPUs). The small data cache that must be shared across dozens of warps (a collection of threads) creates significant cache contention and premature data eviction. Prior works have recognized this problem and proposed warp throttling which reduces the number of active warps contending for cache space. In this paper we discover that individual load instructions in a warp exhibit four different types of data locality behavior: (1) data brought by a warp load instruction is used only once, which is classified as streaming data (2) data brought by a warp load is reused multiple times within the same warp, called intra-warp locality (3) data brought by a warp is reused multiple times but across different warps, called inter-warp locality (4) and some data exhibit both a mix of intra- and inter-warp locality. Furthermore, each load instruction exhibits consistently the same locality type across all warps within a GPU kernel. Based on this discovery we argue that cache management must be done using per-load locality type information, rather than applying warp-wide cache management policies. We propose Access Pattern-aware Cache Management (APCM), which dynamically detects the locality type of each load instruction by monitoring the accesses from one exemplary warp. APCM then uses the detected locality type to selectively apply cache bypassing and cache pinning of data based on load locality characterization. Using an extensive set of simulations we show that APCM improves performance of GPUs by 34% for cache sensitive applications while saving 27% of energy consumption over baseline GPU.

 #### MCM-GPU: Multi-Chip-Module GPUs for Continued Performance Scalability
 Historically, improvements in GPU-based high performance computing have been tightly coupled to transistor scaling. As Moore's law slows down, and the number of transistors per die no longer grows at historical rates, the performance curve of single monolithic GPUs will ultimately plateau. However, the need for higher performing GPUs continues to exist in many domains. To address this need, in this paper we demonstrate that package-level integration of multiple GPU modules to build larger logical GPUs can enable continuous performance scaling beyond Moore's law. Specifically, we propose partitioning GPUs into easily manufacturable basic GPU Modules (GPMs), and integrating them on package using high bandwidth and power efficient signaling technologies. We lay out the details and evaluate the feasibility of a basic Multi-Chip-Module GPU (MCM-GPU) design. We then propose three architectural optimizations that significantly improve GPM data locality and minimize the sensitivity on inter-GPM bandwidth. Our evaluation shows that the optimized MCM-GPU achieves 22.8% speedup and 5x inter-GPM bandwidth reduction when compared to the basic MCM-GPU architecture. Most importantly, the optimized MCM-GPU design is 45.5% faster than the largest implementable monolithic GPU, and performs within 10% of a hypothetical (and unbuildable) monolithic GPU. Lastly we show that our optimized MCM-GPU is 26.8% faster than an equally equipped Multi-GPU system with the same total number of SMs and DRAM bandwidth.
