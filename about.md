![bio_pic](pics/bio_pic1.jpg)

I'm a fresh PhD student at Tsinghua University, majoring in computer system and architecture.

Currently I'm reading papers posted on recent years' ISCA, MICRO, HPCA and ASPLOS.

My hometown is Chengdu, Sichuan.

Keen on music and movies, recently fascinated by trap music and the group Higher Brothers.
